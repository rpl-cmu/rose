# ROSE: Robust Off-road wheel odometry with Slip Estimation

This is the public repository for ROSE, a factor for incorporating wheel odometry measurements into factors graphs to provide increased accuracy, redundancy, and robustness.

## TODO

- [ ] Clean up dependency on custom JRL
- [ ] Clean up dependency on custom gtsam
- [ ] Make only wheel odometry factor easily buildable & installable w/o JRL and other dependencies
- [ ] Clean up wheel factor code, it's a bit messy
